What we would want in a dialogue system:
-make it easy for writers to use
-keep an overview of the content(spot unconnected nodes, see where more content needs to be added etc.)
-be able to easily add responses to (multiple) default buttons as well as the three custom buttons
-be able to make branches that return hook back into other branches
-be able to add a list of timed massage commands 
-be able to have translations (and have it easy to manage, ie not have two seperate databases)
-be able to attach audio files
-be able to have some side branches yet come back to a specific node (for example when interrupted)
-for interruption, count how many times it got interrupted, to get increasingly agitated (also for repeat)
-choose random variation of a dialogue part (for example at the start, or for interruptions)



~Research on alternative dialogue systems~

free, but is going to be unsupported, has different views (map, dropdown), poops out a nice JSON that we'll have to parse ourselves, maybe with ink?

$99/y license for indie devs, might be a bit overkill and might still need to write unity logic depending on the licence

5.99â‚¬/month for cheapest option

Dialogue System for Unity
$65, disco elysium used it, Evaluation Version has watermarks so maybe we can just use that? Editing only within unity (less friendly for writers) a lot of extra option for emotion etc. Many UI and interaction features we will not need

Runemark Dialogue System
similar to above but cheaper $15 and slightly less advance. Has translation support

Phoenix Dialogue System
$10, auto translation. nodes seem complex. no ratings
